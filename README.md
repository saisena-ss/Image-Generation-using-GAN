### Generating MNIST Digits using GAN

## Overview
This project focuses on generating realistic handwritten digits using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically trained on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to demonstrate the capability of GANs in generating new, believable images that resemble actual handwritten digits.

## Features
- **GAN Architecture**: Utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network framework, comprising a generator and a discriminator network, to produce digit images.
- **MNIST Dataset Training**: Employs the MNIST dataset, which includes a wide variety of handwritten digit images, as the training set.
- **Image Generation**: The generator network learns to create new digit images that are convincing enough to fool the discriminator.

## Dataset
- The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, widely used for training various image processing systems.
